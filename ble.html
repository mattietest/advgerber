<b>Bluetooth</b>
<p>One of the biggest drivers between the explosion in the IOT (Internet of Things) market has been the development of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard.
The standard has been adopted by all the major smartphone makers so that it is easier to develop with.  Bluetooth LE is very different from 
the original Bluetooth.  A BLE connection allows for the device to remain connected even if neither device is talking or communicating. The 
device that initiates the conversation is called the peripheral device and it posts data for all to read.   The device that reads the data is 
called the central device.  It is much like a server-client relationship where the central devices are the clients and the peripheral devices 
are the servers.

<b>Assignment- </b><br>
<div style="margin-left: 2.5%;">
<p>
Your task is complete the 4 Bluetooth LE projects and learn how it operates as an introduction to Bluetooth LE.   You will use your Redboard kit and accessories to build a smart switch, lock, 
 weather station and lamp all controlled via Bluetooth LE from your phone.  You will use the LightBlue iOS app and nRF Connect and nRF UART apps for Android.  You will 
 also gain experience adding libraries to your Arduino to make everything work.   
 You will use 
 <a href=https://github.com/MakeBluetooth> this project repository</a> to get all the code for the projects.  
</p>
<p>
1. Assemble the BlueFruit robot. 
</p>  
<p>
2. Add a second musical song to the robot.  
</p>
<p>
3. EXTRA CREDIT-  Decorate Your Robot .
</p>
<p>
4. EXTRA CREDIT- Add sensors to the robot or speed control.
