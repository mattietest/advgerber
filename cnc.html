<b>CNC Routing</b>
<p>CNC routing uses a router in conjuction with a collet and bit or tool to cut various materials using the X, Y and Z axis.  CNC stands 
for computer numerically controlled and usually works using G-code a numerical code langauge for machines.   We will be using both the ShopBot CNC 
and X-Carve for both of our projects.  You could use the Roland mill as well.   The CNC router is useful in cutting various woods, foams, 
metals, and plastics for applications.  You will be using Easel and Vectric software to design (CAD) and cut (CAM) your projects.

<b>Assignment- AI and Machine Learning</b><br>
<div style="margin-left: 2.5%;">
<p>
Your task is to explore AI and machine learning using the Raspberry Pi.  You will complete the AIY Voice Kit with Google and Raspberry Pi and a real time face recognition project using 
the Raspberry Pi and OpenCv.   If you get time you can try to install TensorFlow on the Raspberry Pi.     


<p>
1. Build the AIY Voice Kit
</p> 
 <ul>
  <li>Use this <a href=https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice>link</a> to build 
   your project.  You will need to pick up an AIY kit and work in groups of 2.</li>
  <li> Get your kit built and take a picture of your kit completed. </li>
 </ul>
<p>
2. Install the software  
</p>
 <ul>
  <li> Make sure you follow the instructions to set up the Google Assistant API</li>
  <li> The instructions can be found <a href=https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice#users-guide> using this guide.</a></li>
 </ul>
<p>
3. Create a Voice User Interface and Hook Up An LED, Servo or Motor to it.  
</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Gather the materials needed using your RedBoard kit</li>
   <li>Follow the instructions found either in chapters 6,7, 8, or 9 in your AIY Projects book or this <a href=https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice#makers-guide> link.</a></li>
  </ul> 
<p>
4. Create a Photobooth That Tweets or Not?
</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Gather the following materials: Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Camera Module, buttons, accessories needed</li>
    <li>Follow this <a href=https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/the-all-seeing-pi> guide </a> or this <a href=http://www.thenerdyteacher.com/2016/08/photo-booth-fun-with-raspberrypi-makered.html> guide</a> for how to make a photo booth.</li>
    <li> Here is the <a href=https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/the-all-seeing-pi/tree/master/en/resources> link to the overlays.</a></li>
    <li>Document your project with a picture of the final project and a tweeted or pictured captured by the photo booth.?</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<br>
 <h3> ASSIGNMENT TO DOCUMENT </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>1. Document all of the projects with pictures. </li>
  <li>2. Explain four products that use AI including two that you currently own</li>
  <li>3. What is the future of AI and Machine Learning?</li>
  <li>4. What is an API and why are they so important for both the company and developer?</li>
  <li>5. What is the major concern with AI and Machine Learning? </li>
 </ul>
