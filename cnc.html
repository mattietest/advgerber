<b>CNC Routing</b>
<p>CNC routing uses a router in conjuction with a collet and bit or tool to cut various materials using the X, Y and Z axis.  The router 
 is attached to the gantry and moves on rails.   CNC stands for computer numerically controlled and usually works using G-code a numerical code langauge for machines.   We will be using both the ShopBot CNC 
and X-Carve for both of our projects.  You could use the Roland mill as well.   The CNC router is useful in cutting various woods, foams, 
metals, and plastics for applications.  You will be using Easel and Vectric software to design (CAD) and cut (CAM) your projects.

<b>MIG Welding</b>
<p>Welding is the process of joining to metals together using similar metals.  The weld actually melts the metals you are bonding together. 
 In soldering, you heat the metals to be bonded, but you do not melt them.  The solder acts as the bond between the two metals and is the only 
 metal melted during the process.   We will be using the MIG or gas metal arc welding to weld in class.

<b>Assignment- Welding, CNC Router Sign and CNC Cutting Board </b><br>
<div style="margin-left: 2.5%;">
<p>
    


<p>
1. Welding
</p> 
 <ul>
  <li>Practice your MIG welding on the testing plates.  Lay down several welds to try to make a row of nickels.</li>
  <li> In your group, create a design and weld a project that would be useful in the WIC.  The most obvious would be to create a 
  organizer for the cardboard by the laser cutters.   This must be a group project and everyone must contribute.</li>
    <li>Take pictures of your welds and talk about the process of welding.  Explain what is happening when you weld and the physics behind welding.  What is the difference between a good and bad weld?</li>
 </ul>
<p>
2. CNC Router
</p>
 <ul>
  <li> Create a sign using the CNC router. </li>
    <li> The sign will be made on 3/4 inch MDF and will not exceed 15" x 15".</li>
    <li> Create a sign using the CNC router. </li>
  <li> The instructions can be found <a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLdEiXEsoReqyEzWSAX9APs8srGLIdb38> using these guides.</a></li>
  <li> This <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l28mM1NeFw> link</a> shows another example of how to create a personal sign. </li>
  <li> Include the final file on your website and photos of the process. </li>
 </ul>
<p>
3. Create an inlay cutting board using the CNC router 
</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Gather the materials needed for your project. 6" x12" x1/16" Maple, 6" x 12 x 1/2" Walnut  </li>
   <li> You can see instructions with this <a href=https://www.inventables.com/projects/6-x-12-cutting-board-template?ref=EaselLive&utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=3_project&utm_campaign=Easel%20Live> link.</a></li>
   <li>You will need to create an <a href=http://easel.inventables.com/users/sign_in> Easel </a> account.</li>
 </ul> 
 4. Sublimat 
</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Gather your items to sublimate.   You may sublimate a 15oz mug as well.</li>
   <li> You can see instructions with this <a href=https://dyetrans.com> link.</a> It is important you follow the instructions 
    exactly.  If you apply more heat for longer or less heat at shorter, your sublimation article will not come out as planned.</a></li>
   <li>You will need to get your template <a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z_i8nU7b5I8cCgH9fx9Yu6YTmhjamXZ8?usp=sharing> here. </a></li>
 </ul> 
</p>
</div>

 <h3> ASSIGNMENTS TO DOCUMENT </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>1. Document all of the projects with pictures. </li>
  <li>2. Include a discussion of each project of what you learned</li>
  <li>3. Include all original files</li>

 </ul>
