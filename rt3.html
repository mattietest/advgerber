<h2> Soldering</h2>
 <img src="solder.jpg"/>
 <p> Soldering is essential to what we do in Advanced Digital Fabrication as a way to join components together. 
  We have used a breadboard to this point, however soldering allows us to make our electronic circuits more permanent.  Soldering is joining 
  two or more components together by using a filler material with a lower melting point.  This is much different than welding where you are 
  physically melting the two pieces being joined.

1. Assemble the Voice Controller according to the schematics in the picture.  Use the schematics to place the electronic components 
 where they belong on the circuit. 
</p> 
 <p>A. Include a picture of the finished project</P>
 <p>B. Using the schematic, explain how the voice changer works electronically.  Make sure you use the correct electronics terms when describing 
  what is happening in the circuit. </p>
<p>
2.Include pictures of your soldering project(s)after you completed .
