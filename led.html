<b>LEDs - Light-emitting Diodes</b>
<p>You see LEDs all around.  They are different from light bulbs in that they emit photons when electricity runs through them in the correct direction.
  Remember they are diodes and polarity matters.  This means that LEDs have an anode (positive side) and a cathode (negative side).  It 
  is easy to spot the negative side, cathode, of the the 5mm LED as it has a short leg and a flat side compared to the anode.  Since an LED is a 
  diode and offers no resistence, it must be used with a resistor to prevent the LED from shorting or exploding because of too much 
  current.  A 470 ohm resistor should work for most LED projects we conduct in class.   The more resistance the dimmer the LED will be.  If you wanted 
  to find the exact resistor needed for an LED you can try several<a href=http://led.linear1.org/1led.wiz/> LED resistor calculators.</a>

  <p>LEDs come in a variety of types as illustrated in the picture above.  We will use the 5mm domed, dot matrix, strips and seven segment in our
    projects.  LEDs are measured in millacandella MCD, lumens or watts.  A millacandella is 1,000 MCD equals one candle in brightness.</p>
  <br>
  <p> LED strips are also very commonly used.  You will see analog and addressable LED strips as the two most common.  We will use addressable.  An analog strip has a power 
    and ground wire and it is easy to controller using a controller.  You can purchase single or multi color analog LED strips.  By varying the 
    amount of electricity applied to each color (red, green and blue RGB), you can control the color of each LED.    Addressable strips use communication 
    to each LED or pixel.  This allows for each pixel to be different unlike the analog LED strips.   </p>
