<b>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</b>
<p>
Artificial intelligence is one of the newest fields in science and engineering.  The name was coined in 1956 and work was started on AI in 1943.  Artificial Intelligence is the development of computer systems able to perform the 
tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making and translation of languages.   You will engage in several activities that will engage in artificial intelligence.  
Machine learning is generally studying pattern recognition and computational learning theory to make predictions based upon the data by looking at algorithms.   We will use OpenCV to work on a project that explores machine learning.

<b>Assignment- AI and Machine Learning</b><br>
<div style="margin-left: 2.5%;">
<p>
Your task is to explore AI and machine learning using the Raspberry Pi.  You will complete the AIY Voice Kit with Google and Raspberry Pi and a real time face recognition project using 
the Raspberry Pi and OpenCv.   If you get time you can try to install TensorFlow on the Raspberry Pi.     


<p>
1. Build the AIY Voice Kit
</p> 
 <ul>
  <li>Use this <a href=https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice>link</a> to build 
   your project.  You will need to pick up an AIY kit and work in groups of 2.</li>
  <li> Get your kit built and take a picture of your kit completed. </li>
 </ul>
<p>
2. Install the software  
</p>
 <ul>
  <li> Make sure you follow the instructions to set up the Google Assistant API</li>
  <li> The instructions can be found <a href=https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice#users-guide> using this guide.</a></li>
 </ul>
<p>
3. Create a Voice User Interface and Hook Up An LED, Servo or Motor to it.  
</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Gather the materials needed using your RedBoard kit</li>
   <li>Follow the instructions found either in chapters 6,7, 8, or 9 in your AIY Projects book or this <a href=https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice#makers-guide> link.</a></li>
  </ul> 
<p>
4. Creat Real-Time Facial Recognition Using OpenCV
</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Gather the following materials: Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Camera Module.</li>
    <li>Follow this <a href=https://www.hackster.io/mjrobot/real-time-face-recognition-an-end-to-end-project-a10826> guide </a> for how to create machine learning facial recognition.</li>
 </ul>
